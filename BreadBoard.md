 ### What is a BreadBoard ?<br>
 A breadboard is a rectangular plastic board with a bunch of tiny holes in it. These holes let you easily insert electronic components to prototype (meaning to build and test an early version of) an electronic circuit, like this one with a battery, switch, resistor, and an LED (light-emitting diode). The connections are not permanent, so it is easy to remove a component if you make a mistake, or just start over and do a new project.<br>
 ### How are the Holes inside breadboard connected ?<br>
 The leads of wires or any other component can fit into the breadboard beca3use the inside of a breadboard is made up of sets of five metal clips. This means that each set of five holes forming a half-row (columns A–E or columns F–J) is electrically connected.  
 For example, that means hole A1 is electrically connected to holes B1, C1, D1, and E1. It is not connected to hole A2, because that hole is in a different row, with a separate set of metal clips. It is also not connected to holes F1, G1, H1, I1, or J1, because they are on the other "half" of the breadboard—the clips are not connected across the gap in the middle. Unlike all the main breadboard rows, which are connected in sets of five holes, the buses *(in orange lines)* typically run to the each half of entire length of the breadboard.   <br>
